"""FRAME-track questions from the Job-1 lapchole pass (Gallstone, Absorbable Hemostatic Agent).

Why these two classes are worth a dedicated pass: across the whole gold FRAME train split
(heico + lapchole, 15,212 annotated frames) **Gallstone appears in 51 frames from 6 videos and
Absorbable Hemostatic Agent in none at all**. Only 29 gold questions mention either. So this
annotation is not an increment on existing supervision -- for AHA it *is* the supervision.

What the annotation entails, and what it does not
-------------------------------------------------
The reviewer swept every extracted frame of the video looking for **both** target classes, so
for a video whose CSV we received, the count of Gallstone and of AHA is known on every frame,
including the frames that are absent from the CSV (the CSV is positives-only). That gives us
counts, quadrants, and co-occurrence *between the two targets* in both directions.

It does **not** give us the complete class set. The other-objects checklist was optional in
Job 1 ("only fill it in for frames you have already stopped on"), so a tick proves presence
but a blank proves nothing. That rules out `fo_class` -- which is exact set equality, and the
single highest-value format on this track. If the annotators confirm they ticked the list
exhaustively on every frame they stopped on, `--trust-checklist` turns those on.

Two shortcuts are deliberately closed:

* **class-token shortcut.** These 70 videos are the only place "Gallstone"/"Absorbable
  Hemostatic Agent" would appear, so the class name alone would predict "yes". In-domain
  negatives ask the same co-occurrence questions about gold heico/lapchole frames, answer no.
* **video-identity shortcut.** Frames from the same 70 videos with no target present supply
  the negative half, so the video itself does not predict the answer either.

Geometry: the annotator viewed autocropped frames (38 of 70 videos, median 11% of pixels
removed) while gold frames are the raw video frame. Clicks are therefore mapped back through
`crop_boxes.json` into full-frame coordinates before the quadrant is computed, and the frames
written for training are re-extracted **uncropped** -- otherwise "was cropped" would itself be
a cue, and every quadrant near an axis would be wrong.
